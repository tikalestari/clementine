Here we are going to do another implementation problem, this time using dictionaries. Remember that
a dictionary is basically a hashmap. You assign a key a value, and you can update values for keys later on.

Problem description: The election is coming up and you want to detect for people who are voting more than once.
The way you figure out if someone has voted more than once is by checking to see if someone else has the
exact same name, except the characters are jumbled up. Example:
donald and nldaod. If either name has more or less characters, there can't be a match.

Another thing to note is that you may use the "==" operator on dictionaries. If two dictionaries contain the
same keys with the same values, then "==" will return true for those two dictionaries.

Input description: The first line of input will be an integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases
will follow. The first line of every test case will be an integer N, the number of checks you want to do
for duplicate voting. For each check, you will be given two names, separated by a space.

Output description: For each check in each test case, print whether or not there was a match. If there was
a match, print "YES", if not, print "NO".

YOU MAY NOT USE ANY KIND OF SORT.

Example input:
2
3
cat tac
cat3 cat
gbas sbag
2
29safa safa209
a a

Example output:
YES
NO
YES
NO
