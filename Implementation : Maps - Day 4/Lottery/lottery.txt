Here we are going to test you further on dictionaries. Note that you may use more than one.

Remember that to iterate through a map, you can either iterate only through the keys like this:
for key in map:
  # stuff

Or you can iterate through the key value pairs like this:
for key, value in map.items():
  # stuff

Problem description: You have been tasked with drawing the next lottery winner! Unfortunately,
not all lottery participants are valid participants. This is a special kind of lottery, where you can
only purchase one ticket. You will be given the first and last names of all participants, and the last names
on every ticket sold. You may assume all last names are unique (i.e. no duplicates). Your job is to print
the first and last names of every valid lottery participant.

Input description: The first line of input will be T, the number of test cases. The first line of each test
case will contain two integers, a and b, where a is the number of people who bought a ticket and b is the
number of tickets bought. The next b lines will each contain a single string, the last name of the person who
bought the ticket.

Output description: For each test case, print the first and last names of each valid lottery participant. A valid
lottery participant is a participant who only bought 1 ticket. If there are no valid lottery participants, print "NONE".

Example input:
