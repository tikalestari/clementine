Jessica needs constant monitoring when she does her math homework.Write a function that takes a list of pairs [start, end]
and returns the total amount of time that Jessica was monitored. Each [start, end] pair represents the times when Jessica's
monitoring session goes from start to finish. All values will be positive integers no greater than 2^30 - 1. You will always
have end > start for each interval.

Input description: The first line of input will be an integer T, representing the number of test cases. The first
line of every test case will contain an integer N, which is the number of intervals there are to monitor.

Output description: Print the total amount of time Jessica has been monitored.
