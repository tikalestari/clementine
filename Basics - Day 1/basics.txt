Problem: Given an integer K and some list of integers, return the number of integers in the list
minus K.

Goal: To get your feet wet with standard input/output.

Input description: The first line will contain an integer T, which will be the number of test cases. T
test cases will follow. For each test case, there will be two lines. The first line will contain a single
integer K. The next line will contain a list of space-separated integers.

Output description: Your goal is to count the number of numbers in the list and subtract K from that count,
then output that to standard out. Note that there is NOT a space after the last number.

Sample input:
4
1
1 2 3 4 5
2
1 2 3 4 5
3
1 2 3 4 5
4
1 2 3 4 5

Sample output:
4 3 2 1

Explanation: In the first test case, there are 5 integers and K = 1, thus 5-1 = 4 so we output 4.
